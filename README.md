Solution for detecting the iris and pupil from eye images, unwrapping the iris into a rectangular form, and generating the iris code based on biometric processing methods.

## Description of project

This project was developed during the Biometrics summer semester 2025.  
It focuses on processing eye images to extract iris features using a multi-stage approach:
- Preprocessing of eye images (contrast enhancement, noise smoothing).
- Pupil and iris boundary detection.
- Iris unwrapping from polar coordinates to a rectangular image.
- Generation of the iris code using Gabor wavelets and Daugmanâ€™s method.

The solution supports robust handling of noise, reflections, and eyelid occlusions based on morphological operations and adaptive masking.
